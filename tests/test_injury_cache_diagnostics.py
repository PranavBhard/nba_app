Diagnose injury preload cache state used by master-training Add Columns flow.

This mirrors the SharedFeatureContext preloading logic to verify:
- _injury_cache_loaded is True
- how many (team, season) keys are cached
- how many cached keys have zero player records
- which (team, season) combos from stats_nba are missing in the cache

Usage:
