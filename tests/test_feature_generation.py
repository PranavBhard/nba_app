"""
Test script for feature generation in the training workflow.

Tests the features from the add_columns job to ensure they are calculated correctly:
- travel|days_*|* (including target venue for days_2)
- est_possessions|*|derived|none
- exp_points_off/def/matchup|*|derived|*
- three_pct_matchup|*|derived|* (KNOWN ISSUE: not implemented)
- pace_interaction|*|harmonic_mean|none

KNOWN ISSUES:
- travel|days_2: Some venue_guids in games are missing from nba_venues collection
  (data sync issue - need to populate missing venues)
- three_pct_matchup: Feature is registered but no calculation handler exists
  (needs implementation in stat_handler.py)

Usage:
    source venv/bin/activate
