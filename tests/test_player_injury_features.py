"""
Test that player and injury features are correctly calculated.

This test verifies that:
1. The feature registry returns feature names that match what calculators generate
2. Features are calculated with non-zero values for games with injuries
3. The training data service returns the correct feature list

This test was created after a major bug was found where all player_ and inj_
features were calculating to 0 because the feature registry was generating
theoretical feature names that didn't match what calculators actually return.

Run with:
