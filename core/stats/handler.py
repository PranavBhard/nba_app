StatHandlerV2 - Core Feature Calculation Engine

Enhanced stat handler with exponential weighting and absolute values.

Improvements over StatHandler:
- Exponential decay weighting for historical averages
- Option to return absolute values alongside differentials
- Cleaner interface for rest/fatigue calculations
- Pace and volatility features
- Games played so far (reliability signal)
- Era normalization support
