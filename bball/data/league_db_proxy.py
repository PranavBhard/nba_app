"""
League Database Proxy - Maps legacy collection attribute names to league-configured names.

Provides transparent access to MongoDB collections using either legacy NBA-specific
attribute names (e.g., db.stats_nba) or normalized names (e.g., db.games), resolving
them via the active league's YAML configuration.

Usage:
    from bball.data.league_db_proxy import LeagueDbProxy
    from bball.mongo import Mongo
    from bball.league_config import load_league_config

    league = load_league_config('nba')
    db = LeagueDbProxy(Mongo().db, league)

    # Both work — attribute access resolves through league config:
    db.stats_nba          # -> db['stats_nba'] (from league.collections['games'])
    db.player_stats       # -> db['nba_player_stats'] (from league.collections['player_stats'])
