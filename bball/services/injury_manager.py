Injury Manager Module

Computes and manages injured player data for games.

An injured player is defined as:
- On the team's roster (player has played for team before and after game date)
- Did not play in the game (stats.min == 0 or missing)
- Has at least 1 prior game for this team before the game date
- Last prior game was within 25 days of the game date

This module provides the core logic shared between CLI and web interfaces.

League-aware: Uses normalized collection names (games, player_stats) that work
with LeagueDbProxy for multi-league support.
