"""
Shared Feature Generator for efficient feature computation.

This module provides a SharedFeatureGenerator class that generates features once
for a given game, avoiding redundant DB queries when multiple models need features
from the same game (e.g., ensemble base models).

Key benefits:
- Single stat handler and PER calculator instance
- Generates superset of features needed by all models
- Each model extracts its subset from the shared feature dict

Uses data layer repositories for all database operations.
