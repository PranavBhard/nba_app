Injury Feature Calculator — standalone injury feature computation.

Computes injury-related features for basketball games:
- Per-player injury impact (PER-weighted, minutes-weighted)
- Team rotation impact (minutes lost, severity)
- Season-to-date injury severity
- Normalized/deconfounded injury metrics
- Star-based injury features

Usage:
    calculator = InjuryFeatureCalculator(db=db, league=league)
    # For prediction: inject preloaded data
    calculator.set_preloaded_data(games_home, games_away)
    # Compute features
