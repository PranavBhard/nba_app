PER Calculator - Player Efficiency Rating computation module

Implements Hollinger's PER formula:
1. uPER (unadjusted PER) - raw per-minute efficiency
2. aPER (pace-adjusted PER) - adjusted for team pace
3. PER (normalized) - scaled so league average = 15

Optimizations:
- Preloads stats_nba_players into memory to avoid 27k+ DB queries
- Caches computed PER features per game to MongoDB

Usage:
    from per_calculator import PERCalculator
    
    # With preloading (fast for batch processing)
    calc = PERCalculator(preload=True)
    
    # Without preloading (for single queries)
    calc = PERCalculator(preload=False)
    
    # Get team PER aggregates for game prediction
    features = calc.get_game_per_features(home_team, away_team, season, game_date)
