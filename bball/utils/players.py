Player Filtering Utilities - Core Infrastructure

Shared logic for building player lists for predictions.

CRITICAL: PREDICTION-ONLY MODULE

This module is specifically designed for PREDICTION workflows, NOT training data generation.

## Data Source Distinction:

### TRAINING (DO NOT USE THIS MODULE):
- Uses: stats_nba.homeTeam.injured_players and stats_nba.awayTeam.injured_players
- These are HISTORICAL snapshots captured when games were actually played
- Represents ground truth for "who was actually injured when this game happened"
- Handled by: InjuryFeatureCalculator.get_injury_features() and per_calculator with game_doc.injured_players

### PREDICTION (USE THIS MODULE):
- Uses: nba_rosters.roster[].injured, nba_rosters.roster[].starter, nba_rosters.roster[].disabled flags
- These are USER-EDITABLE via the game_details UI toggles
- Gets updated in real-time for upcoming game predictions
- Used by: web/app.py predict() endpoint and agents/matchup_predict.py

## When to use this module:
- Web app prediction endpoints (api/predict)
- Agent prediction tools (matchup_predict.py)
- NOT for training data generation (BballModel.create_training_data)
- NOT for feature calculation for historical games (InjuryFeatureCalculator, per_calculator)

Uses data layer repositories for all database operations.

    Build player_filters dict for PREDICTION with injury/starter information.

    PREDICTION-ONLY: This function uses nba_rosters for injury/starter data.
    DO NOT use for training data generation (which requires stats_nba.injured_players).

    Rosters are the single source of truth. Player status is determined by
    three flags on each roster entry:
    - disabled=True  -> skip entirely (excluded from predictions)
    - injured=True   -> add to 'injured' list (not in 'playing')
    - starter=True   -> add to 'starters' list (if not injured/disabled)

    Args:
        home_team: Home team abbreviation (e.g., 'LAL')
        away_team: Away team abbreviation (e.g., 'BOS')
        season: Season string (e.g., '2023-2024')
        db: MongoDB database instance

    Returns:
